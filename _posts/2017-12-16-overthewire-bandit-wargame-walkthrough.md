Lately, I've been having a lot of fun with wargames, particularly those done
by [OverTheWire](http://overthewire.org/wargames/). As such I thought it might
be fun to do a quick writeup of their first recommended wargame, Bandit, which
is catered to people just getting started with Linux.

Writeup in progress...
