<p>
  I'm Josh Dow. I live in Boston, MA with my fiance, two cats, and one child. I've 
  been <a href="/blog/software-development">programming</a> as a hobby since 
  I was a teenager and professionally for the past 6 years.
</p>      
<p>
  <a href="/blog/information-security">Information Security</a> is a big passion of mine. 
  So many posts on this blog will be about things like penetration testing, application security, 
  and reverse engineering. I also participate in a number of CTFs, which I peridocially 
  do <a href="/blog/walkthroughs">walkthroughs</a> on.
